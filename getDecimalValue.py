# Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

# Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def getDecimalValue(self, head: ListNode) -> int:
        ans = 0
        while head:
            ans = 2*ans + head.val
            head = head.next
        return ans

# Time Complexity = O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
# Space Complexity = O(1) as No extra space is used
